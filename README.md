* About
A gif api project. On load of the page the gif buttons will be generated, when clicked on it will load a series of still gifs from giphy via their API. When the gif is clicked it will start playing, when clicked again it will go back to a still.The user can add new gif buttons via the search bar. 

* Objective
   - To demonstrate the mastery of API's , AJAX requests, and Jquery. 

* Approach
    - The first step was to get the API working, and to save the results to a variable.
    - Next I created the functionality to capture the user's input and display the buttons to the page upon it loading/other buttons being added.
    - After that I created the function to display the gifs on the pafe by clicking a button.
    - Lastly I added data atributes to each of the gifs displayed so that on click it would switch between the still and moving states by changing their atributes,
